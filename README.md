# Fixed Point by pnltoen
First of all thanks to Nvidia Jetpack, Hai Loc Lu (Nvidia Isaac sim), bkircher67(who help me to solve these problems)
Unfortunately due to Jetpack and plain images are updated. there are some issues when i followed the reinforcemnt learning blog post.
To run Reinforcement Learning i edited two .sh files (Thanks to bkircher67)

First. configure.sh 
Second. build.sh

in my case when i edited configure.sh it didn't work
so i also edited build.sh to coreect L4T version.

You can just edit your jetbot/docker/configure.sh and jetbot/docker/build/build.sh
or clone my files and paste it jetbot/docker

thanks
